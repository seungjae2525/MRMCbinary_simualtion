# Simulation Code and Results

This repository contains the simulation code and results for the following paper:
**"Evaluating diagnostic accuracy of binary medical tests in multi-reader multi-case study."**

The materials are organized to reproduce the simulation results in Sections 2.3 and 5 of the manuscript.

There are two main folders in this repository, as follows:
- `Simulation in Sec 2.3`: Contains simulation code and results related to Section 2.3 of the manuscript.
- `Simulation in Sec 5`: Contains simulation code and results related to Section 5 of the manuscript.

For details on each folder and the files within it, please refer to the descriptions below.



## Simulation in Sec 2.3

### üîç Additional Notes
- For detailed simulation settings, please refer to Section S2.2 of the Supplementary Material.
- Make sure to specify an appropriate working directory before running the code.
- All simulation studies were conducted on the x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) platform, running under Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS, utilizing 100 CPU cores through parallel processing, and took approximately 13 minutes to complete (for a total of 6 combinations).

### üì• Download RData file

- The `Simulation in Sec 5.RData` file size is too large to be uploaded directly to this repository (about 895MB).
- Therefore, you can download the `Simulation in Sec 5.RData` file (output files (`.RData`) from Simulation in Sec 5.R) from the [latest release](https://github.com/seungjae2525/MRMCbinary_simualtion/releases/latest).
- Before loading the downloaded file in R, change the file name from "Simulation.in.Sec.5.RData" to "Simulation in Sec 5.RData".



### üîç Additional Notes
- For detailed simulation settings, please refer to Section 5 in the main manuscript.
- Make sure to specify an appropriate working directory before running the code.
- The currently uploaded results are for the only combination reported in the paper.
- To see results for other combinations, see the results after modifying "beta_0_v", "beta_2k_v", and "beta_3k_v" values ‚Äã‚Äãin lines 42‚Äì44 of `Summary and plot for simulation in Sec 5.R`.
- All simulation studies were conducted on the x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) platform, running under Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS, utilizing 100 CPU cores through parallel processing, and took approximately 12 hours to complete (for a total of 288 combinations).
