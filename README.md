# Simulation Code and Results

This repository contains the simulation code and results for the following paper:
**"Evaluating diagnostic accuracy of binary medical tests in multi-reader multi-case study."**

The materials are organized by the sections of the manuscript that they support.

There are two main folders:
- `Simulation in Sec 2.3`: Contains simulation code and results related to Section 2.3 of the manuscript.
- `Simulation in Sec 5`: Contains simulation code and results related to Section 5 of the manuscript.

For details on each folder, please refer to the descriptions below.

### üîç Additional Notes
- For detailed simulation settings, please refer to Section 2.3 of the manuscript.
- Make sure to specify an appropriate working directory before running the code.





## Simulation in Sec 5

This folder contains R scripts and result files used to generate simulation results for Section 2.3 of the manuscript. Below is a brief description of each subfolder and file:

### üìÅ Folder Contents

| File | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Rcodes`      | Contains all R scripts used for the simulation study. These include the main loop, data generation, model fitting functions, and summary routines. |
| `Results`     | Output files (e.g., `.rds`) generated from the simulation. These include saved estimates, convergence status, and timing information. |
| `README.md`   | This file. Provides an overview of the contents in this folder. |

### üîç Additional Notes
- For detailed simulation settings, please refer to Section 2.3 of the manuscript.
- Make sure to specify an appropriate working directory before running the code.
- The currently uploaded results are for the only combination reported in the paper.
- To see results for other combinations, see the results after modifying "beta_0_v", "beta_2k_v", and "beta_3k_v" values ‚Äã‚Äãin lines 42--44 of `Summary and plot for simulation in Sec 2.3.R`.
