# Simulation Code and Results

This repository contains the simulation code and results for the following paper:
**"Evaluating diagnostic accuracy of binary medical tests in multi-reader multi-case study."**

The materials are organized to reproduce the simulation results in Sections 2.3 and 5 of the manuscript.

There are two main folders, as follows:
- `Simulation in Sec 2.3`: Contains simulation code and results related to Section 2.3 of the manuscript.
- `Simulation in Sec 5`: Contains simulation code and results related to Section 5 of the manuscript.

For details on each folder and the files within it, please refer to the descriptions below.

The simulation study was conducted on a Windows 11 x64 (build 26100) system, utilizing 100 CPU cores through parallel processing, 
and took a total of xx hours and yy minutes to complete.
